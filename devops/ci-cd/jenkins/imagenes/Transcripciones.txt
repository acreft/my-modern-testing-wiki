Jenkins project has two release lines, long-term support and weekly.
In this video, I will demonstrate how to install the latest long-term support release of Jenkins on an Ubuntu 20.4 server.
Be advised that the installation steps may vary for the other operating systems.
The entire installation process will be performed in a terminal.
Let's go ahead and get started.
I'm logged into the Ubuntu server as root.
One of the prerequisites for installing Jenkins is Java.
Let's go ahead and install Java version 11.
Java has been successfully installed.
We are now ready to install Jenkins.
We will first import the GPG key for Jenkins repo.
Next, we'll add the repo to the list of Debian sources.
Update package index.
And install Jenkins package.
Next, we will verify the Jenkins UI.
On my browser I will enter Jenkins URL.
It is time to unlock Jenkins.
I will need to retrieve the password from the Jenkins server.
Back to terminal.
I will use the 'cat' command.
Copy the password.
Click "Continue".
Install suggested plugins.
Create first admin user.
Click "Save" and "Continue".
My Jenkins URL looks good.
I'll go ahead and click "Start using Jenkins".
And this is the Jenkins Dashboard.
